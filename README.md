## KWARA STATE UNIVERSITY (KWASU)

This is a web platform created to share information and notes amongst KWASU students as well as those willing to know about the school.

The website built with the awesome framework, [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and hosted with the amazing platform, [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I also use [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org) for Content Managament.<br/><br/>
