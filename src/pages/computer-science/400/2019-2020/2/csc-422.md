## Assignments

1. Write a short note on **Scope Creep**.

> Scope creep (sometimes known as “requirement creep” or even “feature creep”) refers to how a project’s requirements tend to increase over a project lifecycle, e.g. what once started out as a single deliverable becomes five. Or a product that began with three essential features, now must have ten.

Scope creep is typically caused by key project stakeholders changing requirements, or sometimes from internal miscommunication and disagreements.
