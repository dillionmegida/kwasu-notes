## What is C.G?
Computer Graphics is the act of using computers as a rendering and sketching tool for the generation and manipulation of images.

It is the act of drawing images on a computer with the use of programming.

C.G is represented with pixels (picture elements).

Pixels have two characteristics
- Color of each pixel
- Location of each pixel

A **pixel number** is referred to as resolution hence the higher the pixel, the higher the resolution.
Resolution is the degree of fineness with which an image is created. It refers to pixel spacing  - the distance from one pixel to the next pixel.

**Rendering or Image Synthesis** is the automatic process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model by means of computer programs.

### Applications of Computer Graphics
- Display of information
- Graphic Design
- User interfaces
- Design professionals
- Computer Simulation
- Computer aided design
- Video games
- Digital art
- Virtual reality
- Web design
- Animation software
- Paint programs.

**A pixel** is the smallest object or color spot that can be displayed and addressed as a monitor.

## HARDWARE CONCEPT
### Input
These are devices which users uses to generate necessary instruction or data ffro creating graphics e.g keyboard, mouse, trackball, joystick, touch panel and so on. Based on logical interaction types, the input devices can be classified as:
- Locator device
- Pick device
- Valuator device
- Keyboard or text input device
- Choice device

**Taplex:** It has a digitizer which is a component that picks points on an object
<br/>
**Touch Panels:** Allows users to touch parts of an object through screens

### Display Systems
These are devices through which graphics are related e.g CRT based display, liquid crystal, LED, plasma ased display and stereoscopic display.
The main output device is VDU -  Visual Display Unit. The CRT - Cathode Ray Tube is the main component of the VDU.

Common types of display systems
- Raster Scan display
- Random scan display
- Direct view storage tube
- 3D viewing devices
- Stereoscope and virtual reality system.
The display systems are often referred to as **Video Monitor or Video displaying unit**.

**Aspect Ratio:** is the ratio of the number of X pixels to the number of Y pixels. The standard AR of PCs is 4:3

### RASTER SCAN
The electron beam is swept accross the screen, one row at a time from top to bottom. Picture definition is stored in a memory area called the **Refresh Buffer** or **frame Buffer**.

#### Random Scan (Vector Scan)
The electron beam is directed only to the part of the screen where the picture is to be drawn rather than scanning from left to right. 	Picture definition is stored as a set of line drawing commands in an area of memory referred to as the **refresh display file**<br/>
There are two ways to display object on screen.
- Raster Scan
- Random Scan

### Cathode Ray Tube
- Electron gun emits a beam of electrons (cathode rays)
- The electron beam passes through focusing and deflection system that directs it towards specified positions on the phosphorocited screen.
- When the beam hits the screen, the phosphor emits a small spot of light at each position contacted by the electrom beam.
- It reduces the picture by directing the electron beam back over the same screen points quickly.

## LINE GENERATION ALGORITHM
A line connects two points. Line drawing algorithm is a graphical algorithm for approximating a line segment on discrete graphical media.
Discrete media such as pixel based displays and printers.

**Bitmap:** refers to series of bits that represents a rasterized graphic image each pixel being represented as a group of bits.

### Digital Differential Algorithm (DDA)
The DDA is a simple line generation algorithm used for the rasterization of lines, triangles and polygons.

#### Advantages of DDA
- Simple algorithm does not require special skills for implementation.
- It is a faster method for calculating pixel positions than the direct use of equation ***y = mx + b***
- It is independent of programming language
- It eliminates the multiplication in the equation by making use of raster characteristics.

#### Disadvantages
- It is consuming and expensive
- Rounding off is time consuming
- Pixels drift farther apart if line is relatively larger
- Floating point addition is still needed
- Precision loss because of rounding off.

### Bresenhams Line Drawing Algorithm
This is an algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points.
