## What is Artificial Intelligence?

This is a branch of science which deals with helping machines find solutions to complex problems in a more human friendly fashion.

### Importance of AI

- Game Playing
- Speech Recognition
- Computer Vision
- Understanding Natural Language
- Expert System
- Heuristic Classification

### Applications of AI

- Consumer Marketing
- Machine Translation
- Identification Technology
- Internet Agent
- Robotic & Navigation, e.t.c

### Goals of AI

To develop,

- machines that behave
- systems that learn, demonstrate, explain and advice its users
- systems that understand, think and behave like human.

## What is Intelligence?

Can be described as the ability to infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.

### Constitutes of Intelligence

- Reasoning
- Perception
- Learning
- Solving Problems

Learn about the constitutes [in this documentation](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence)

### Types of Intelligence

- Linguistic Intelligence
- Spatial Intelligence
- Musical Intelligence
- Interpersonal Intelligence
- Intra-personal Intelligence

## Agents

An agent is anything that can perceive its environment through **sensors** and acts upon that environment through **effectors**.

## Problem Solving Techniques in AI

A problem is a collection of information that the agent will use to decide what to do.

- **State:** the state of the world in which the search agent finds itself
- **Start State:** initial state from where the search agent begins
- **Goal State:** also regarded as optimal state i.e the intended solution unto which an agent is designed to reach.
- **Actions:** all steps taken to reaching a goal state
- **Solution:** The path in the search tree from the starting state to the goal state
- **Cost Function:** a function that assigns a cost to a path. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the individual actions along the path. It is denoted by ***g***
- **State Space:** set of all states present in a problem.
